# Tutorial 1: Setting up the Environment

### Introduction

An operating system generally runs on physical hardware, but it can make development slow to need to load files onto the device every time we need to test something. Instead, we can use `qemu` to emulate the hardware and test our operating system directly on our computers. This will make development a lot easier, although we do occasionally need to program differently so RaspOS works with both `qemu` and the hardware.
