## RaspOS

This is a custom operating system I am developing for fun, and for no serious purpose. It's eventual goal is to group multiple Pi's into a single computing cluster controllable similar to SLURM. However, this project assumes that there is only a single user on the system, and thus uses unconventional scheduling practices.
